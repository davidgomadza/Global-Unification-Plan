# Global-Unification-Plan
To connect all the world fast and cheaper without all the bridging issues.
After all the bridging issues of transfering one token to the other make this the best likely method. We plan to make Global Transaction Payment Solution GTPS available on every platform and as a native token to that platform instead of the bridged form.
We create a Global Reserve Bank that will have all platforms' GTPS and people can simply bring/swap GTPS say from Matic and swap that for GTPS from say Fuse then take that GTPS and swap it in Fuse network for any. Fast cheaper no bridging fees.
Issues to work on: The impact of deploying tokens on every platform.
Issues with inflation and if any how to control it.
But this should be a win solution to all the bridging in that it reduces costs and time. Mind you this is our main task to coordinate and provide a smooth platform to see global cooperation and networking.
In that regard the benefits might outweigh the costs as there are no high bridging fees. Secondly there are no high waiting times its a matter of taking the correct form of GTPS to where you want it and swap it without the bridging.
Any ideas in developing this in reality are welcome pm me @ welcome@gtps.finance
